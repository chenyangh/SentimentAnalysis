### Processed data files

Since the limit of github, only one original data file is added. Since the data processing might take time and the use 
of nltk module can be unwanted.
The data file is uploaded to [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bwz-gNlFG7V8Nnp1bERjUG9TcEE?usp=sharing).

All data files can be read using pickle
* clean_data, each item is in the format of [[list of words], label]
* clean_data2, each item is in the format of [string of clean words, label ]
